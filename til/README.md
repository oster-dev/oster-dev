**Python | Data Exploration with Pandas**
- Exploring DataFrames with `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.shape`, `.columns`, `.dtypes`
- Finding NaN values with `.isnull().sum()` and cleaning with `.dropna()` / `.fillna(0)`
- Selecting columns with `df['col']` and `df[['col1', 'col2']]`
- Accessing individual cells with `df['col'][index]` and `.loc[index]`
- Finding min/max values and their positions with `.min()`, `.max()`, `.idxmin()`, `.idxmax()`
- Sorting data with `.sort_values()` and adding new columns with `.insert()`
- Renaming columns with `.rename(columns={...})`
- Aggregating and grouping with `.groupby()` + `.sum()` / `.mean()` / `.count()`

**Python | Data Visualisation with Matplotlib**
- Cleaning date formats with `pd.to_datetime()`
- Reshaping DataFrames with `.pivot(index=, columns=, values=)`
- Replacing missing values after pivot with `.fillna(0, inplace=True)`
- Checking for NaN across entire DataFrame with `.isna().values.any()`
- Creating line charts with `plt.plot(x, y)`
- Styling charts with `.figure(figsize=)`, `.xlabel()`, `.ylabel()`, `.ylim()`, `.legend()`
- Plotting multiple lines in one chart
- Smoothing time series data with `.rolling(window=6).mean()`

**SQL | Comments & UNION**
- Inline comments with `--` and block comments with `/* */`
- `UNION` removes duplicates · `UNION ALL` keeps all rows
- Practice Test 2 completed ✅

**Python | Pandas & Matplotlib**
- Used `.describe()` to get a quick statistical summary of a DataFrame
- Converted string columns to proper datetime with `pd.to_datetime()`
- Resampled two DataFrames to the same monthly frequency with `.resample('ME').sum()` and `.asfreq('ME')` to align them for comparison
- Smoothed noisy time series data with `.rolling(window=6).mean()` to reveal underlying trends
- Checked data quality with `.isna().values.sum()` before analysis
- Formatted a date-based x-axis using `YearLocator` and `DateFormatter` from `matplotlib.dates`
- Built a dual y-axis chart with `ax.twinx()` to overlay two datasets with different scales on one figure
- Differentiated two lines visually using `linestyle='--'` and `linestyle='-.'` combined with `'o'` and `'^'` markers
- Set `dpi=200` to export high-resolution charts and fine-tuned layout with `xlim`, `ylim`, `linewidth` and HEX colour codes
- Added `.grid()` to make seasonal patterns easier to read across a long time range

**Key Insight | Google Trends as a Leading Indicator**
- Noticed that search interest in *"unemployment benefits"* spiked weeks **before** the official unemployment rate appeared in FRED data
- Confirmed by the COVID spike in April 2020 where UNRATE hit ~14.7% — web searches predicted it earlier
- Concluded that search volume can be used as a real-time economic signal ahead of official reporting

**SQL | String Functions**
- Combined first and last name columns into a single field using `CONCATENATE`
- Located the position of a character inside a string with `POSITION` to split or validate data
- Extracted specific parts of a string by position and length using `SUBSTRING`
- Measured string length with `LENGTH` for data validation and cleaning
- Standardised casing across inconsistent text data with `LOWER` and `UPPER`

**SQL | Mathematical Functions & Operators**
- Applied `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` directly inside `SELECT` to compute derived columns on the fly
- Rounded query results to two decimal places with `ROUND()` for cleaner output
- Used `CEILING()` and `FLOOR()` to round values up or down to the nearest integer
- Retrieved absolute values from negative numbers with `ABS()` for distance and deviation calculations
- Calculated remainders with `MOD()` to filter even/odd rows and implement modulo-based logic
